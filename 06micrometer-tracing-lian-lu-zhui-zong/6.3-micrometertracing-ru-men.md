# 6.3 micrometer-tracing 入门

这里，我将官网的话复制过来：

Micrometer Tracing contains a core module with an instrumentation [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service\_provider\_interface), a set of modules containing bridges to various tracers, a set of modules containing dedicated span reporting mechanisms, and a test kit. You need to understand the following definitions for distributed tracing:

Micrometer Tracing borrows [Dapper’s](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html) terminology.

**Span**: The basic unit of work. For example, sending an RPC is a new span, as is sending a response to an RPC. Spans also have other data, such as descriptions, timestamped events, key-value annotations (tags), the ID of the span that caused them, and process IDs (normally IP addresses).

Spans can be started and stopped, and they keep track of their timing information. Once you create a span, you must stop it at some point in the future.

**Trace**: A set of spans forming a tree-like structure. For example, if you run a distributed big-data store, a trace might be formed by a `PUT` request.

**Annotation/Event**: Used to record the existence of an event in time.

**Tracer**: A library that handles the lifecycle of a span. It can create, start, stop and report spans to an external system via reporters / exporters.

**Tracing context**: For distributed tracing to work the tracing context (trace identifier, span identifier, etc.) must be propagated through the process (e.g. over threads) and over the network.

**Log correlation**: Parts of the tracing context (e.g. trace identifier, span identifier) can be populated to the logs of a given application. One can then collect all logs in a single storage and group them via trace id. That way one can get all logs, for a single business operation (trace) from all services put in a chronological order.

**Latency analysis tools**: A tool that collects exported spans and visualizes the whole trace. Allows easy latency analysis.

The following image shows how **Span** and **Trace** look in a system.
